                <p>
                    I am a Junior Developer and recent graduate from Auburn University with my Bacholor of Science in Computer Science. I
                    love exploring new technologies and have a passion for Web Developemnt, UI design, and UX Design. I am a self taught web
                    developer currently looking for employement in Webdevelopent. During my time at Auburn I was involded in Student
                    Goverment. I was the Advocacy Chair for Auburn Spectrum, The student LGBTQ+ organization, My job was to respresent our
                    Club and by extension every LGBTQ+ student on campus. During my time in the Inclusion and Diversity comittee I lead
                    research to expand student housing for more inclusivity placement in dorms. <br><br>
                    
                    In the class room I worked on various projects that exelerated my knowledge in programming. One of my favorite projects
                    that I worked on was in my Software Modeling and Design course. I created a store management application that kept
                    inventory of all the items in the shop. This class was taught through application and real world senarios. My client Mr.
                    Smith needed a simple GUI to manage his stores inventory. This appliucation was built in Java, Java spring UI, and that
                    backend data was stored using a MySQL database. I was involved in every stage of the developemnt process. At the end of
                    each milestione we sent updates on our progress and my professor. He acted as the client by simulated feedback in our
                    grading. The outcome was I got see how a real world project is made from start to finish.
